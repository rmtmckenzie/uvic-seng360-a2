DR1:
Answer is checked for id before it is referenced, so therefore
it answer[id] must exist.

DR2:
Given that answer is checked for id on line 85 and
the code will not be executed if it doesn't,
answer[id] must exist.

DR3:
The value of 'key' must be of the form hotspot<number> where
<number> is in self.hotspots. Because of the template verification,
all elements in hotspots are known valid indices of the plaintext.
'ind' is this <number>.
self.ciphertext is the same length as plaintext.

Therefore, self.ciphertext[ind] is guaranteed to be valid, as 
ind is a known valid index of the ciphertext.

DR4:
We know that val is in the range 0...25 because it is an index of ALPHABET.
K is a positive integer. Therefore val + k is a positive integer.
(val + K) % 26 is a value in the range 0...25. Because the length
of ALPHABET is 26, this is guaranteed to be a valid index.
